**Checklist:**

- [ ] Added relevant notes to [WIP-CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/elastisys/compliantkubernetes-apps/blob/main/WIP-CHANGELOG.md)
- [ ] Proper commit message prefix on all commits
- [ ] Updated the [public facing documentation](https://github.com/elastisys/compliantkubernetes)
- Metrics checks:
  - [ ] The metrics are still exposed and present in Grafana after the change
  - [ ] The metrics names didn't change (Grafana dashboards and Prometheus alerts are not affected)
  - [ ] The metrics names did change (Grafana dashboards and Prometheus alerts were fixed)
- Logs checks:
  - [ ] The pods logs do not show any errors
- Network Policy checks:

- Gatekeeper PSPs checks:
  - [ ] Gatekeeper PSPs do not block the pods from starting after the change
- Falco checks:
  - [ ] No Falco alerts are generated by the change
- Is this changeset backwards compatible for existing clusters? Applying:
  - [ ] Is completely transparent, will not impact the workload in any way.
  - [ ] Requires running a migration script.
  - [ ] Will create noticeable cluster degradation.
        E.g. logs or metrics are not being collected or Kubernetes API server
        will not be responding while upgrading.
  - [ ] Will change any APIs.
        E.g. removes or changes any CK8S config options or Kubernetes APIs.
- Chart checklist (pick exactly one):
  - [ ] I upgraded no Chart.
  - [ ] I upgraded a Chart and determined that no migration steps are needed.
  - [ ] I upgraded a Chart and added [migration steps](https://github.com/elastisys/compliantkubernetes-apps/blob/main/migration).

**Pipeline config** *(if applicable)*
If you change some config options (e.g. add/rename variable or change the default value) you may need to update the config used by the pipeline in `pipeline/config`.

<!--
Here are the commit prefixes and comments on when to use them:
all: (things that touch on more than one of the areas below, or don't fit any of them)
apps: (changes to the applications running in both/all clusters)
apps sc: (changes to applications in the service cluster)
apps wc: (changes to applications in the workload cluster)
docs: (documentation)
tests: (test related changes)
pipeline: (the pipeline)
config: (configuration, e.g. add/remove/rename a parameter, this is not for changes to the default values for an application that would go into `apps [sc/wc]`)
bin: (changes to binaries or scripts used manage ck8s)
release: (anything release related)

Example commit prefix usage:

git commit -m "docs: Add instructions for how to do x"
