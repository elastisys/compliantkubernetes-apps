### Release notes

- Configuration for the certificate issuers has been changed and requires running the [migration script](migration/v0.6.x-v0.7.x/migrate-issuer-config.sh).'
- Remove `alerts.opsGenieHeartbeat.enable` and `alerts.opsGenieHeartbeat.enabled` from your config file `sc-config.yaml`.
- Run `ck8s init` again to update your config files with new options (after checking out v0.7.0).

### Added

- Support for providing certificate issuer manifests to override default issuers.
- Configurable extra role mappings in Elasticsearch
- Added falco exporter to workload cluster
- Falco dashboard added to Grafana
- Config option to disable redirection when pushing to Harbor image storage.

### Changed

- Configuration value `global.certType` has been replaced with `global.issuer` and `global.verifyTls`.
- Certificate issuer configuration has been changed from `letsencrypt` to `issuers.letsencrypt` and extended to support more issuers.
- Explicitly disabled multitenancy in Kibana.
- Cloud provider dependencies are removed from the templates, instead, keys are added to the sc|wc-config.yaml by the init script so no more "hidden" config. This requires a re-run of ck8s init or manully adding the missing keys.

### Fixed

- Kibana OIDC logout not redirecting correctly.
- Getting stuck at selecting tenant when logging in to Kibana.
- Typo in elasticsearch slm config for the schedule.
- Pushing images to Harbor on Safespring
- Typo in Alertmanager config regarding connection to Opsgenie heartbeat
