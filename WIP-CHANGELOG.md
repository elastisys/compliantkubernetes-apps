### Release notes

- In 1.7 the cert-manager API versions v1alpha2, v1alpha3, and v1beta1, have been removed from the custom resource definitions (CRDs).
- In 1.8 the cert-manager will validate the spec.privateKey.rotationPolicy on Certificate resources. Valid options are Never and Always.
- Automated CIS tests are preformed on each node using kube-bench
- Harbor upgraded to v2.6.0. Requires a harbor restore.

### Updated

- Updated `kubectl` requirement to version `1.24.4`
- Harbor upgraded to v2.6.0.

### Changed
- OIDC scope to include groups for all services
- OIDC enabled by default for ops grafana

- The ThanosReceiveHttpRequestErrorRateHigh, OpenSearchTooFewNodesRunning, and MetricsFromScClusterIsMissing prometheus-alerts were optimized to not be triggered by kured and to reduce other unwanted behaviors.
- Support section of the grafana/opensearch welcome dashboards is removed by default, you can now add custom text at the end of the dashboards via the sc-config.
- OpenSearch has been upgraded from version `v1.3.4` to `v2.6.0`. Our fluentd-plugins was also changed from using "fluent-plugin-opensearch: 1.0.2" to "fluent-plugin-opensearch: 1.0.8".

### Fixed
- Fixed so grafana can show data from thanos that's older than 30 days (downsampled data)
- Fixed so opensearch field limit alert handles metrics drop better
- Fixed spelling error so now the grafana test framework in sc will be uninstalled
- Fixed issue where security admin would fail if separate nodes for data and/or client was used
