### Release notes

- Changed from depricated nfs provisioner to the new one. Migration is automatic (no manual intervention)

### Changed

- The sc-logs-retention cronjob now runs without error even if no backups were found for automatic removal

### Fixed
- The `clusterDns` config variable now matches Kubespray defaults.
  Using the wrong value causes node-local-dns to not be used.
