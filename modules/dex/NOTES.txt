A template for writing a Configuration (https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/concepts/packages).

To use this template:
1. Replace the name, metadata in crossplane.yaml to reflect your Configuration.
2. Add dependencies in crossplane.yaml.
3. Update the sample CompositeResourceDefinition and Composition in the `apis/`
   directory to reflect the API you're designing for your platform, and optionally add more if needed.
4. Add/Update examples in the `examples/` directory.
5. Update the `README.md`, to be about your Configuration!

To build and push your Configuration to a registry, run the following commands
using the Crossplane CLI:

`crossplane xpkg build`
(Optionally) `crossplane xpkg login`
`crossplane xpkg push your-org/your-repo:v1.0.0`

Check the README.md for more information and have fun building your Configuration!
