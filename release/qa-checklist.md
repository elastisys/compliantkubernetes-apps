# Quality Assurance Checklist

Elastisys WelkinÂ® Apps

## Checklist

> [!note]
> This document is maintained as a reference for the quality assurance checklist for Welkin Apps.
> The actual release and quality assurance process is driven by an internal issue template, as it also ties together with internal processes, however these are templated from the same source so the main steps are accurate.

### Overview

### <a id="before-qa-steps" href="#user-content-before-qa-steps">#</a> Before QA steps

> [!note]
> Whenever you need to change access from platform administrator to application developer `dev@example.com` prefer to re-login rather than impersonation `--as=dev@example.com`.
> For this you have two options:
>
> - Either set a different cache directory `export KUBECACHEDIR=${HOME}/.kube-static/cache` when switching to application developer and restore `unset KUBECACHEDIR` when switching to platform administrator.
> - Or clear the cache `rm -r ~/.kube/cache/oidc-login` whenever you switch between.

- [ ] Ensure the release follows [the release constraints](https://github.com/elastisys/compliantkubernetes-apps/tree/main/release#constraints)
- [ ] Complete [the feature freeze step](https://github.com/elastisys/compliantkubernetes-apps/tree/main/release#feature-freeze)
- [ ] Complete [the staging step](https://github.com/elastisys/compliantkubernetes-apps/tree/main/release#staging)

- [ ] Rclone sync - Enabled and preferably configured to a different infrastructure provider.
- [ ] If possible let the environment stabilise into a steady state after the install
    - Best is to perform the install at the end of the day to give it the night to stabilise.
    - Otherwise give it at least one to two hours to stabilise if possible.
- [ ] Set the environment variable `NAMESPACE` to an application developer namespace (this cannot be a subnamespace)
- [ ] Set the environment variable `DOMAIN` to the environment domain

#### Automated tests

> [!note]
> Many checks have turned into automated end-to-end tests, and some may currently be a bit rough around the edges.
> Do take note of any issues you have with them so we can improve upon them.
> If you have any questions about them ask QAE or in their absence QA goto.

> [!important]
> From the `tests/` directory.

> [!tip]
> By default the Cypress tests will run headless, if you want visual feedback during testing you can export the variable `CK8S_HEADED_CYPRESS=true` before running.

- [ ] Successful `make build-main`.
- [ ] Successful `make run-end-to-end/apps`

> [!warning]
> The log-manager tests has an involved setup which may fail, so the function of log-manager might need to be checked manually.
>
> With Cilium as network plugin it is expected that the Grafana and NetworkPolicy tests will fail, and the dashboard must be checked manually, you can track [their implementation here](https://github.com/elastisys/compliantkubernetes-apps/issues/2726).

#### Application developer scenario

> [!note]
> As application developer `dev@example.com`
>
> The following checklist items aim to verify relevant parts of the public docs.
> It should be done with an exploratory mindset, and therefore some don't have well defined steps.
>
> This could be either in the context of what you would use as an application developer, what is new for this release, or in a situation with an error that would have you need to check that status of the application.

#### GPU support

> [!important]
> GPU support checks should be done on _one_ of the scenarios, either install or upgrade.
> If you are using Cluster API as the installer you must setup GPU nodes with auto-scaling as that is tested.
> If you are using Cluster API as the installer follow [this guide](https://github.com/elastisys/mse-internal-docs/blob/main/docs/ops-manual/enable-and-operate-gpu.md) to configure the GPU worker pool.

    ```

#### Upgrade

- [ ] Can upgrade according to [the migration docs for this version](https://github.com/elastisys/compliantkubernetes-apps/tree/main/migration)
- [ ] If possible let the environment stabilise into a steady state after the upgrade
    - Best is to perform the upgrade at the end of the day to give it the night to stabilise.
    - Otherwise give it at least one to two hours to stabilise if possible.

#### Automated tests

> [!note]
> Many checks have turned into automated end-to-end tests, and some may currently be a bit rough around the edges.
> Do take note of any issues you have with them so we can improve upon them.
> If you have any questions about them ask QAE or in their absence QA goto.

> [!important]
> From the `tests/` directory.

> [!tip]
> By default the Cypress tests will run headless, if you want visual feedback during testing you can export the variable `CK8S_HEADED_CYPRESS=true` before running.

>
> With Cilium as network plugin it is expected that the Grafana and NetworkPolicy tests will fail, and the dashboard must be checked manually, you can track [their implementation here](https://github.com/elastisys/compliantkubernetes-apps/issues/2726).

#### Application developer scenario

> [!note]
> As application developer `dev@example.com`
>
> The following checklist items aim to verify relevant parts of the public docs.
> It should be done with an exploratory mindset, and therefore some don't have well defined steps.
>
> This could be either in the context of what you would use as an application developer, what is new for this release, or in a situation with an error that would have you need to check that status of the application.

    <!-- TODO: Create a Grafana dashboard to assist in measuring metrics for QA --->
    If there is a large change compared to before the upgrade that cannot be supported by the changes done in the release then this should be investigated as this may point towards:

    - Errors caused by incompatible or misbehaving components or configurations
    - Unintentional addition or removal of components

    If there are clear issues then this should be fixed.
    If there are no clear issues, or if fixing the issues would require substantial work, then talk with the QAE, or TLs if they are unavailable, about either accepting or taking additional actions.
- [ ] Check the metrics in Grafana and review any indications of errors and warnings

#### Restore backups and snapshots

> [!note]
> As platform administrator
<!--divide-->
> [!important]
> Before running each restore you should either completely or partially delete the data within the target service, and after each restore validate that the data is restored.

Follow the public disaster recovery documentation to perform restores from the prepared backups:

- [ ] Can [run Rclone restore](https://github.com/elastisys/compliantkubernetes-apps/blob/main/restore/rclone/README.md)
    - _Examples of deleted data: Complete or partial removal of data with buckets or containers for Fluentd logs or Thanos, avoid tampering with Harbor, OpenSearch, and Velero._
- [ ] Can [restore Harbor backup](https://elastisys.io/welkin/operator-manual/disaster-recovery/#restore_1)
    - _Examples of deleted data: Complete or partial removal of Harbor configuration, project or user data._
- [ ] Can [restore OpenSearch snapshot](https://elastisys.io/welkin/operator-manual/disaster-recovery/#restore)
    - _Examples of deleted data: Complete or partial removal of OpenSearch indices and documents._
- [ ] Can [restore Velero snapshot](https://elastisys.io/welkin/operator-manual/disaster-recovery/#restore_2)
    - _Examples of deleted data: Complete or partial removal of application developer Kubernetes resources._

### <a id="after-qa-steps" href="#user-content-after-qa-steps">#</a> After QA steps

- [ ] Update the Welcoming Dashboards "What's New" section.

  Add items for new feature or changes that are relevant for application developers, e.g. for `v0.25` "- As an application developer you can now create namespaces yourself using HNC ...".

  Remove items for releases older than two major or minor versions, e.g. for `v0.25` you keep items for `v0.25` and `v0.24` and remove all items for all older versions.

    - Edit the [Grafana dashboard](https://github.com/elastisys/compliantkubernetes-apps/tree/main/helmfile.d/charts/grafana-dashboards/files/welcome.md)
