# Release process

The releases will follow semantic versioning and be handled with git tags.
https://semver.org/

## Major and minor releases

1. To release a major or minor version create a release branch `release-X.Y` from the last minor release tag.

```bash
git checkout vA.B.0
git checkout -b release-X.Y
git push -u origin release-X.Y
```

2. Checkout the branch to cut the release from.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b branch_name
```

3. Run the release script.

```bash
./release/release.sh X.Y.Z
```

The release script will:
* Append what is in `WIP-CHANGELOG.md` to `CHANGELOG.md`
* Clear `WIP-CHANGELOG.md`
* Create a git commit with message `Release vX.Y.Z`
* Create a tag named `vX.Y.Z`

4. Push the tagged commit, create a PR against the release branch and request a review.

```bash
git push --atomic origin branch_name vX.Y.Z
```

5. Merge it to finalize the release.
A [GitHub actions workflow pipeline](.github/workflows/release.yml) will create a GitHub release from the tag.

*GitHub currently does not support merging with fast-forward only.
Merge the release PR locally and push it instead.*

```bash
git checkout release-X.Y
git merge --ff-only branch_name
git push
```

## Patch releases

1. Create a new branch based on a release branch and commit the patch commits to it.

```bash
git checkout release-X.Y
git pull
git checkout -b branch_name
git cherry-pick [some fix in main]
git add -p file-with-some-new-fixes
git commit
```

2. Continue from step 3 in the major/minor release flow.

## While developing

When a feature or change is developed on a branch fill out some human readable
bullet points in the `WIP-CHANGELOG.md` this will make it easier to track the changes.
Once the release is done this will be appended to the main changelog.

## Structure

The structure follow the guidelines of [keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Changelogs are for humans, not machines. Keep messages in human readable form rather
than commits or code. Commits or pull requests can off course be linked. Add messages
as bullet points under one of theese categories:

* Breaking changes
* Release notes
* Added
* Changed
* Deprecated
* Removed
* Fixed
* Security

When creating a major release a section of `Release highlights` should be added
on top of the WIP-changelog with a summary of the most important changes.

You can link comments to related pull requests with `PR#pr-number`. Commit ids can be linked
by just writing that commits short hash or full hash.
