# Release process

The releases will follow semantic versioning and be handled with git tags.
https://semver.org/

## Major and minor releases

1. To release a major or minor version create a release branch `release-X.Y` from the last minor release tag.

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git checkout -b release-X.Y
    git push -u origin release-X.Y
    ```

1. Reset changelog

    ```bash
    git checkout -b reset-changelog-X.Y
    release/reset-changelog.sh X.Y.0
    ```

    The release script will:
    * Append what is in `WIP-CHANGELOG.md` to `CHANGELOG.md`
    * Clear `WIP-CHANGELOG.md`
    * Create a git commit with message `Reset changelog for release vX.Y.Z`

    Make sure that the changes only include changes mentioned above, and then push.

    ```
    git diff HEAD~1
    git push -u origin reset-changelog-X.Y
    ```

1. Merge `reset-changelog-X.Y` into `release-X.Y` then, into `main` as soon as possible to minimize risk of conflicts

    **NOTE**: The release action will fail since we haven't tagged the release commit.
    We will do that after QA.

1. Create a `QA-X.Y` branch and run QA checks on this branch.

    ```bash
    git checkout release-X.Y
    git checkout -b QA-X.Y
    git push -u origin QA-X.Y
    ```

    **NOTE**: All changes made in QA should be added to `CHANGELOG.md` and **NOT** `WIP-CHANGELOG.md`.
    Also, make sure to not merge any fixes into `release-X.Y` on this step.

1. When the QA is finished, create the release tag.

    ```bash
    git tag vX.Y.0
    ```

1. Push the tagged commit, create a PR against the release branch and request a review.
   If there are no changes, create the release manually instead by going to [releases](https://github.com/elastisys/compliantkubernetes-apps/releases) and clicking "Draft a new release".
   Check older releases for how to word it.

    ```bash
    git push --tags
    ```

1. Merge it to finalize the release.

    Since the tag is referencing a specific commit hash we need to retain it after the PR (via e.g. fast-forward merge).

    *GitHub currently does not support merging with fast-forward only in PRs.
    Merge the release PR locally and push it instead.*

    ```bash
    git checkout release-X.Y
    git merge --ff-only QA-X.Y
    git push
    ```

    A [GitHub actions workflow pipeline](/.github/workflows/release.yml) will create a GitHub release from the tag.

1. Merge any fixes from the release branch back to the `main` branch `git cherry-pick` can be used, e.g.

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git checkout -b release-X.Y-fixes
    git cherry-pick <fix 1 hash> [<fix 2 hash>..]
    git push -u origin release-X.Y-fixes
    ```

    Create a PR and merge the fixes into main.

9. Update public release notes.

    When a released is published the public [user-facing release notes](https://github.com/elastisys/compliantkubernetes/blob/main/docs/release-notes.md) needs to be updated. The new release needs to be added and the list can be trimmed down to only include the supported versions.

    Add bullet points of major changes within the cluster that affects the user as defined [here](https://compliantkubernetes.io/user-guide/). This includes any change within the cluster that may impact the user experience, for example new or updated feature, or the deprecation of features.

    Finish it of with one bullet point regarding the overall changes of the release in regards to updates, fixes, or other improvements.

## Patch releases

1. Create a new branch based on a release branch and commit the patch commits to it.

    ```bash
    git checkout release-X.Y
    git pull
    git checkout -b branch_name
    git cherry-pick [some fix in main]
    git add -p file-with-some-new-fixes
    git commit
    ```

2. Continue from step 3 in the major/minor release flow.

## While developing

When a feature or change is developed on a branch fill out some human readable
bullet points in the `WIP-CHANGELOG.md` this will make it easier to track the changes.
Once the release is done this will be appended to the main changelog.

## Structure

The structure follow the guidelines of [keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Changelogs are for humans, not machines. Keep messages in human readable form rather
than commits or code. Commits or pull requests can off course be linked. Add messages
as bullet points under one of theese categories:

* Breaking changes
* Release notes
* Added
* Changed
* Deprecated
* Removed
* Fixed
* Security

When creating a major release a section of `Release highlights` should be added
on top of the WIP-changelog with a summary of the most important changes.

You can link comments to related pull requests with `PR#pr-number`. Commit ids can be linked
by just writing that commits short hash or full hash.
