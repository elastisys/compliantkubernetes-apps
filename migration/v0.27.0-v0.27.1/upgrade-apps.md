# Upgrade v0.27.0 to v0.27.1

## Steps

1. Update apps configuration:

    This will take a backup into `backups/` before modifying any files.

    ```bash
    bin/ck8s init
    ```

1. Add new harbor credentials

    ```bash
    ./migration/v0.27.x-v0.28.x/add-registry-credentials.sh
    ```

1. Migrate harbor jobservice port to ports (array)

    ```bash
    ./migration/v0.27.x-v0.28.x/move-harbor-jobservice-port-to-ports.sh
    ```

1. Up date the IPs for harbor replication in `$CK8S_CONFIG_PATH/sc-config.yaml`

    ```yaml
      harbor:
        registries:
          ips:
            - "set-me"
    ```


1. Upgrade applications:

    ```bash
    bin/ck8s apply {sc|wc}
