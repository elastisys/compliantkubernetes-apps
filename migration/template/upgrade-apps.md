# Upgrade ${old_version}.x to ${new_version}.x

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Notify the users (if any) before the upgrade starts;
- [ ] Check if there are any pending changes to the environment;
- [ ] Check the state of the environment, pods, nodes and backup jobs:

    ```bash
    ./bin/ck8s test sc|wc
    ./bin/ck8s ops kubectl sc|wc get pods -A -o custom-columns=NAMESPACE:metadata.namespace,POD:metadata.name,READY-false:status.containerStatuses[*].ready,REASON:status.containerStatuses[*].state.terminated.reason | grep false | grep -v Completed
    ./bin/ck8s ops kubectl sc|wc get nodes
    ./bin/ck8s ops kubectl sc|wc get jobs -A
    velero get backup
    ```

- [ ] Silence the notifications for the alerts. e.g you can use [alertmanager silences](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/#silences);

## Steps that can be done before the upgrade - non-disruptive

1. Pull the latest changes and switch to the correct branch:

    ```bash
    git pull
    git switch -d ${new_version}.0
    ```

1. Update apps configuration:

    This will take a backup into `backups/` before modifying any files.

    ```bash
    ./bin/ck8s init
    ```

## Upgrade steps

1. Upgrade applications:

    ```bash
    ./bin/ck8s apply {sc|wc}
    ```

## Postrequisite:

- [ ] Check the state of the environment, pods and nodes:

    ```bash
    ./bin/ck8s test sc|wc
    ./bin/ck8s ops kubectl sc|wc get pods -A -o custom-columns=NAMESPACE:metadata.namespace,POD:metadata.name,READY-false:status.containerStatuses[*].ready,REASON:status.containerStatuses[*].state.terminated.reason | grep false | grep -v Completed
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

- [ ] Enable the notifications for the alerts;
- [ ] Notify the users (if any) when the upgrade is complete;

> **_Note:_** Additionally it is good to check:

- if any alerts generated by the upgrade didn't close;
- if you can login to Grafana, Opensearch or Harbor;
- you can see fresh metrics and logs.
