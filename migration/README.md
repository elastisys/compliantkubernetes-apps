# Migration steps

## Migration template and script

> [!NOTE] Only major releases are supported by the script

There is a script that can help you create the initial migration folder and `upgrade-apps.md` document. You can use the following command to run it from the root of compliantkubernetes-apps directory:

```bash
./migration/create-migration-document.sh v0.66 v0.67
```
