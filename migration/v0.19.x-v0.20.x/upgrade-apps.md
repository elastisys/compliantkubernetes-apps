## Prerequisites

## Steps

1. Run the migration script: `move_log_retention_days.sh`

1. Run the migration script: `move-alertmanager-groupby.sh`

1. Run the migration script: `move-usergroups-user-grafana.sh`

    This will take a backup into `backups/` before modifying any files.

   ```bash
   bin/ck8s ops kubectl {sc|wc} -n monitoring delete secret starboard
   ```

1. Update starboard-operator custom resource definitions:

   ```bash
   bin/ck8s ops kubectl {sc|wc} apply -f helmfile/upstream/starboard-operator/crds
   ```

1. Upgrade applications:

    ```bash
    bin/ck8s apply {sc|wc}
    ```
