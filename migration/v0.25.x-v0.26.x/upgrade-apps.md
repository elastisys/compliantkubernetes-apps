# Upgrade v0.25.x to v0.26.x

## Steps

1. Create a backup for harbor

    ```
    ./bin/ck8s ops kubectl sc create job -n harbor harbor-backup-v026 --from=cronjobs/harbor-backup-cronjob
    ./bin/ck8s ops kubectl sc wait --for=condition=complete job -n harbor harbor-backup-v026 --timeout=-1s
    ```

1. Login into harbor and check what projects, images, users, robot accounts, etc exists. As these will be restored after the upgrade

1. Update apps configuration:

    This will take a backup into `backups/` before modifying any files.

    ```bash
    bin/ck8s init
    ```

1. Migrate harbor jobservice persistence storage size variable and prepare harbor for upgrade.

    ```
    ./migration/v0.25.x-v0.26.x/migrate-harbor-database-variables.sh
    ./bin/ck8s ops kubectl sc delete ingress -n harbor --all
    ./bin/ck8s ops kubectl sc delete jobs -n harbor init-harbor-job
    ```

1. *Optional:* If you are upgrading an environment of an Elastisys customer then run this script to add a customer support message to the grafana/opensearch "welcoming dashboards":

    > [!NOTE] This script requires yq4

    ```bash
    ./migration/v0.25.x-v0.26.x/add-support-message.sh
    ```

1. *Optional:* You can remove the Opensearch role mapping `readall_and_monitor` from `${CK8S_CONFIG_PATH}/sc-config.yaml` if you aren't using it in any meaningful way

1. Apply `starboard-operator` to temporarily remove the starboard psp

    ```bash
    bin/ck8s ops helmfile {sc|wc} -l app=starboard-operator apply
    ```

1. *Optional:* You can enable kured reboot slack notifications:

    a. Go to [Manage Slack Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps), `Install App` tab and copy the `Bot User OAuth Token` to `${CK8S_CONFIG_PATH}/secrets.yaml` file. You may need to ask your Administrator to add you as a collaborator:

    ```
    kured:
      slack:
        botToken: abcxyz-...
    ```

    b. Enable the slack notification and add the channel in `${CK8S_CONFIG_PATH}/common-config.yaml`:

    ```
    notification:
      slack:
        enabled: true
        channel: kured-notification
    ```

1. *Note:* About OpenSearch certificates

    > Applicable if OpenSearch Securityadmin fails when running apply with something similar to this:
    > ```console
    > ERR: An unexpected SSLHandshakeException occurred: PKIX path building failed
    > ```

    This might happen if the environment has changed domain since OpenSearch first was set up since the new internal HTTP certificate won't match the other internal certificates.
    The fix is to remove the old certificates and issuers, and then rebuild the chain of trust.

    Remove old certificates and issuers:

    ```bash
    ./bin/ck8s ops kubectl sc -n opensearch-system delete certificates opensearch-admin opensearch-ca opensearch-http opensearch-transport
    ./bin/ck8s ops kubectl sc -n opensearch-system delete issuers opensearch-ca opensearch-selfsigned
    ```

    Check that the corresponding secrets for these certificates get deleted and delete them if they are left!

    Then rebuild the chain of trust:

    ```bash
    ./bin/ck8s ops helmfile sc -l app=opensearch-secrets sync
    ```

    Restart any OpenSearch pods:

    ```bash
    ./bin/ck8s ops kubectl sc -n opensearch rollout restart sts opensearch-master
    # With separate data or client pods:
    # ./bin/ck8s ops kubectl sc -n opensearch rollout restart sts opensearch-data
    # ./bin/ck8s ops kubectl sc -n opensearch rollout restart sts opensearch-client
    ```

    Re-run securityadmin:

    ```bash
    ./bin/ck8s ops helmfile sc -l app=opensearch-securityadmin destroy
    ./bin/ck8s ops helmfile sc -l app=opensearch-securityadmin apply
    ```

    Then continue to run apply and make sure to check so OpenSearch Dashboards works afterwards else you need to restart it.

1. Upgrade applications:

    ```bash
    bin/ck8s apply {sc|wc}
    ```

1. Restore harbor by following the documentation for restoring harbor.
    Ensure that it is the new config map that is added to the cluster.
    [Restore documentation](../../scripts/restore/README.md)

1. Login into harbor and check that projects, images, users, robot accounts, etc exists after the restore is completed.

1. Delete old harbor pvc

    ```
    ./bin/ck8s ops kubectl sc delete pvc -n harbor data-harbor-harbor-redis-0 data-harbor-harbor-trivy-0 database-data-harbor-harbor-database-0 harbor-harbor-jobservice
    ```

1. Remove any old stuck jobs in the monitoring namespace. Other wise starboard operator will not create any new jobs.

    ```
    ./bin/ck8s ops kubectl sc delete jobs -n monitoring --all
    ./bin/ck8s ops kubectl wc delete jobs -n monitoring --all
    ```
