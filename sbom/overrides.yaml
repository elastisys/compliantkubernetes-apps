helmfile.d/upstream/kubernetes-external-dns/external-dns:
  evaluation: >-
    🟢 This project looks sufficiently health for Welkin.
    It seems vendor neutral, organizationally and technologically
    mature.

helmfile.d/upstream/dexidp/dex:
  evaluation: >-
    🟢 Dex is a CNCF sandbox project, which means it is
    community-driven open-source and has passed some bar for
    organizational and technical maturity. Given the complexity of the
    project and the availability of alternatives, such as Keycloak,
    sandbox is sufficient for the mission and vision of Welkin.

helmfile.d/upstream/falcosecurity/falco/charts/falco-talon:
  evaluation: >-
    🟡 This project seems to fall under Falco, which is a
    CNCF graduated project. However, it seems to receive significant
    contributions from a single author. This is not an issue right now,
    but we'll monitor the project.

    community-driven open-source and has passed a high bar for

    use the official Chart. This is not a problem for now.
