helmfile.d/upstream/dexidp/dex:
  evaluation: >-
    ðŸŸ¢ Dex is a CNCF sandbox project, which means it is
    community-driven open-source and has passed some bar for
    organizational and technical maturity. Given the complexity of the
    project and the availability of alternatives, such as Keycloak,
    sandbox is sufficient for the mission and vision of Welkin.

helmfile.d/upstream/jetstack/cert-manager:
  evaluation: >-
    ðŸŸ¢ cert-manager is a CNCF graduate project, which means it is
    community-driven open-source and has passed a high bar for
    organizational and technical maturity.
