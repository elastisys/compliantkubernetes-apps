helmfile.d/charts/calico-accountant:
  evaluation: >-
    游리 This is a Chart maintained by Elastisys. It incorporates

  evaluation: 游릭 This is a glue Chart maintained by Elastisys.

helmfile.d/charts/external-dns-secrets:
  evaluation: 游릭 This is a glue Chart maintained by Elastisys.

helmfile.d/upstream/kubernetes-external-dns/external-dns:
  evaluation: >-
    游릭 This project looks sufficiently health for Welkin.
    It seems vendor neutral, organizationally and technologically
    mature.

helmfile.d/upstream/dexidp/dex:
  evaluation: >-
    游릭 Dex is a CNCF sandbox project, which means it is
    community-driven open-source and has passed some bar for
    organizational and technical maturity. Given the complexity of the
    project and the availability of alternatives, such as Keycloak,
    sandbox is sufficient for the mission and vision of Welkin.

helmfile.d/upstream/falcosecurity/falco/charts/falco-talon:
  evaluation: >-
    游리 This project seems to fall under Falco, which is a
    CNCF graduated project. However, it seems to receive significant
    contributions from a single author. This is not an issue right now,
    but we'll monitor the project.

helmfile.d/upstream/falcosecurity/falco:
  evaluation: >-
    游릭 Falco is a CNCF graduated project, which means it is
    community-driven open-source and has passed a high bar for

helmfile.d/charts/file-copier:
  evaluation: 游릭 This is a glue Chart maintained by Elastisys.

helmfile.d/upstream/kokuwa/fluentd-elasticsearch:
  evaluation: >-
    游리 Fluentd is a CNCF graduated project, which means it is
    community-driven open-source and has passed a high bar for
    organizational and technical maturity. However, we don't
    use the official Chart. This is not a problem for now.

helmfile.d/upstream/bitnami/fluentd:

helmfile.d/upstream/nvidia/gpu-operator:
  evaluation: >-
    游릭 This is the best option if we want to consume NVIDIA hardware.

helmfile.d/charts/grafana-dashboards:
  evaluation: 游릭 This is a glue Chart maintained by Elastisys.

helmfile.d/charts/grafana-label-enforcer:
  evaluation: >-
    游리 The license is okay (Apache 2.0), but I get the feeling that
    the maintainer base is rather small. No action needed right now,
    as this is a rather small component, which we can easily deal with.

helmfile.d/upstream/prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack/charts/grafana:
  evaluation: >-
    游리 Grafana is the leading tol for querying and visualizing time
    series and metrics. However, it is not community-driven and the
    company behind it (Grafana Labs) may change the license at any
    time. If that happens, we could consider replacing it with
    OpenSearch.
    Right now Grafana is licensed under AGPL-3.0-only.
    No action is needed at this time, but we should avoid further
    adoption.

helmfile.d/charts/hnc/config-and-crds:
  evaluation: >-
    游리 HNC is unfortunately deprecated. Its API is exposed
    to our customers, so replacing it needs to be done carefully.
    It is a rather small component, so there is not urgency to
    replace it as of now.

helmfile.d/charts/hnc/controller:

helmfile.d/upstream/falcosecurity/falco/charts/k8s-metacollector:

    游리 k8s-metacollector seems to be work-in-progress. However,
    it is part of the broader Falco project, which is a CNCF graduated
    project.

helmfile.d/upstream/prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack:
  evaluation: >-
    游릭 Prometheus is a CNCF graduated project. The Kube Prometheus Stack
    is the leading solution to deploying Prometheus.
