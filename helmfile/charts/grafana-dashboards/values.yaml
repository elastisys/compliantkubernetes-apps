# Key for the labels we add to the ConfigMaps
# This will be used to set the labels like this:
# labels:
#   {{ .Values.labelKey }}: nameOfDashboard
labelKey: grafana_dashboard

# We use the value for the "lablekey" to separate the ops and user dashboards in Grafana.
# Grafana-ops will load all ConfigMaps regardless of the "labelkey" value
# Grafana-user will load only the ConfigMaps that have the value for "labelkey" set to 1. All dashboard will be visible to the developer, unless they are added into the notDeveloperVisible list.

# We will create one ConfigMap per dashboard in the .Release.Namespace. The namespace is defined in 50-applications.yaml
# The name of the file containing the JSON for the dashboard should follow this naming convention: `[dashboardName]-dashboard.json`
