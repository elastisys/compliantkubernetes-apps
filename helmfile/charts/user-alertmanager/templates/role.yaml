# This role grants users privileges to configure a specific secret used by alertmanager
# and to grant others these same privileges by creating rolebindings to this role.
#
# Note! This makes it possible for the user to break alertmanager both by adding
# bad config and by deleting the rolebinding used to give alertmanager access to the
# restricted PSP.
