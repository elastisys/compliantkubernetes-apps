## v0.7.0 - 2020-11-09

### Release notes

- Configuration for the certificate issuers has been changed and requires running the [migration script](migration/v0.6.x-v0.7.x/migrate-issuer-config.sh).'
- Remove `alerts.opsGenieHeartbeat.enable` and `alerts.opsGenieHeartbeat.enabled` from your config file `sc-config.yaml`.
- Run `ck8s init` again to update your config files with new options (after checking out v0.7.0).
- Update your `yq` binary to version `3.4.1`.

### Added

- Support for providing certificate issuer manifests to override default issuers.
- Configurable extra role mappings in Elasticsearch
- Added falco exporter to workload cluster
- Falco dashboard added to Grafana
- Config option to disable redirection when pushing to Harbor image storage.

### Changed

- Configuration value `global.certType` has been replaced with `global.issuer` and `global.verifyTls`.
- Certificate issuer configuration has been changed from `letsencrypt` to `issuers.letsencrypt` and extended to support more issuers.
- Explicitly disabled multitenancy in Kibana.
- Cloud provider dependencies are removed from the templates, instead, keys are added to the sc|wc-config.yaml by the init script so no more "hidden" config. This requires a re-run of ck8s init or manully adding the missing keys.
- Version of `yq` have been updated to `3.4.1`.

### Fixed

- Kibana OIDC logout not redirecting correctly.
- Getting stuck at selecting tenant when logging in to Kibana.
- Typo in elasticsearch slm config for the schedule.
- Pushing images to Harbor on Safespring
- Typo in Alertmanager config regarding connection to Opsgenie heartbeat

-------------------------------------------------
## v0.6.0 - 2020-10-16

### Breaking changes
- The old config format of bashscripts will no longer be supported. All will need to use the yaml config instead. The scripts in `migration/v0.5.x-0.6.x` can be used to migrate current config files.
- The new Opendistro for Elasticsearch version requires running the steps in the [migration document](migration/v0.5.x-v0.6.0/opendistro.md).


### Release notes
- The `ENABLE_PSP` config option has been removed and it needs to be removed from `config.sh` before upgrading.
  See more extensive migration instructions [here](migration/v0.5.x-v0.6.0/psp.md).

- `CK8S_ADDITIONAL_VALUES` is now deprecated and no longer supported. Everything needed can now be set as values in config files.
- All bash and env config files have been replaced to yaml config.
- Before upgrading, add the `CK8S_FLAVOR` variable to your `config.sh`.
  It can be set to either `dev` or `prod` and will impact the validation.
  For example, the `prod` flavor will require a value for `OPSGENIE_HEARTBEAT_NAME`.
  If you want to keep the current behavior (no new requirements for validation) set the value to `dev`.
- Add `logRetention.days` to your `sc-config.yaml` to specify retention period in days for service cluster logs.
- To updatge apps to use the 'user' rather than 'customer' text you will need to destroy the customer-rbac chart first
  ./ck8s ops helmfile wc -l app=customer-rbac destroy
  Also note the existing config for clusters must be changed manually to migrate from customers to users
- Add `letsencrypt.prod.email` and `letsencrypt.staging.email` to your `sc-config.yaml` and `wc-config.yaml` to specify email addresses to be used for letsencrypt production certificate issuers and staging ("fake") certificate issuers, respectively. Additionally, old issuers must be deleted before `ck8s bootstrap` is run; they can be deleted by running the migration script `remove-old-issuers.bash`.

### Changed
- Yq is upgraded to v3.3.2
- Customer kubeconfig is no longer created automatically, and has to be created using the `ck8s user-kubeconfig` command.
- Storageclasses are installed as part of `ck8s bootstrap` instead of together with other applications.
- `ck8s apply` now runs the steps `ck8s bootstrap` and `ck8s apps`.
- Namespaces and Issuers are installed as part of `ck8s bootstrap` instead of together with other applications.
- `blackbox-exporter` uses ingress for health checking workload cluster kube api
- Renamed the flavors: `default` -> `dev`, `ha` -> `prod`.
- Group alerts by `severity` label.
- Pipeline is now prevented from being run if only .md files have been modified.
- When pulling code from `ck8s-cluster`, the pipeline targets the branch/tag `master@v0.5.0` instead of `cluster`
- Upgraded `helmfile` to version v0.129.3
- Removed `hook-failed` from opendistro helm hook deletion policy
- Upgraded ck8s-dash to v0.3.2
- By default, ES snapshots are now taken every 2 hours
- Continue on error in pipeline install apps steps
- `jq` upgraded to `1.6`
- Update ck8sdash helm chart values file to use the correct index for kubecomponents logs
- References to customer changed to user
- Helm is upgraded to v3.3.4
- Opendistro for Elasticsearch is updated to v1.10.1
- Falco chart updated to v1.5.2
- Falco image tag updated to v0.26.1

### Added
- Added `ck8s validate (sc|wc)` to the cli. This command can be run to validate your config.
- Helm secrets as a requirement.
- InfluxDB metric retention size limit for each cluster is now configurable.
- InfluxDB now uses a persistent volume during the backup process.
- Added `ck8s bootstrap (sc|wc)` to the CLI to bootstrap clusters before installing applications.
- Added `ck8s apps (sc|wc)` to the CLI to install applications.
- CRDs are installed in the bootstrap stage.
- Kibana SSO with oidc and dex.
- Namespaces and Issuers are installed in bootstrap
- S3 region to influxdb backup credentials.
- Kube apiserver /healthz endpoint is exposed through nginx with basic auth.
- Added alerts for endpoints monitored by blackbox.
- The flavors now include separate defaults for `config.sh`.
- Set opsgenie priority based on alert severity.
- New ServiceMonitor scrapes data from cert-manager.
- Cronjob for service cluster log backup retention.
- InfluxDB volume size is now configurable
- In the pipeline the helm relese statuses are listed and k8s objects are printed in the apps install steps.
- Alertmanager now generates alerts when certificates are about to expire (< 20 days) or if they are invalid.
- Letsencrypt email addresses are now configurable.

### Fixed
- Fixed syntax in the InfluxDB config
- Elasticsearch eating up node diskspace most likely due to a bug in the performance_analyzer plugin.
- InfluxDB database retention variables are now used.

### Removed
- InfluxDB backups are automatically removed after 7 days.
- `CK8S_ADDITIONAL_VALUES` is now deprecated and no longer supported. Everything needed can now be set as values in config files.
- `set-storage-class.sh` is removed. The storage class can now be set as a value directly in the config instead.
- Elasticsearch credentials from ck8sdash.
- Broken elasticsearch api key creation from ck8sdash.
- The `ENABLE_PSP` config value is removed. "Disabling" has to be done by creating a permissive policy instead.
- Removed post-install-script.sh and infra.json which removes the dependency between ck8s apps and cluster.
